Feature: Failures
  In order to automate varisous processes about testing Vim plugins,
  As a lazy Vim user,
  I want to get a proper exit status according to test results.

  Background:
    Given a repository "kana/vim-vspec" from offline cache

  Scenario: Failed test cases
    Given a flavorfile with:
      """ruby
      # No dependency
      """
    And a file named "plugin/foo.vim" with:
      """vim
      let g:foo = 3
      """
    And a file named "t/basics.vim" with:
      """vim
      runtime! plugin/foo.vim
      describe 'g:foo'
        it 'is equal to 5'
          Expect g:foo == 5
        end
      end
      """
    When I run `vim-flavor test`
    Then it should fail with regexp:
      """
      -------- Preparing dependencies
      Checking versions...
        Use kana/vim-vspec ... 1\.\d+(\.\d+)?

      Completed.
