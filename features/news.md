## vim-flavor 4.0.0

### Incompatible changes

* Ruby 3.0 or later is required now.




## vim-flavor 3.0.0

### Enhancements

* Steps to start using vim-flavor are simplified.  Especially, it is not
  necessary to edit vimrc.

### Incompatible changes

* Vim 8.0 or later is required now.
* Deployment format is changed.  It might be necessary to manually delete some
  directories and files.  See also the follwoing migration guide.
* The name of configuration file is changed.
  * Old name is `VimFlavor`.
  * New name is `Flavorfile`.
  * Note that old name is still supported for backward compatibility.  Old
    name file is used if there is no new name file.  But it is highly
    recommended to rename.
* The name of lock file is changed.
  * Old name is `VimFlavor.lock`.
  * New name is `Flavorfile.lock`.
  * To avoid unexpected result and confusion, vim-flavor stops its process as
    soon as possible if old name lockfile exists.

### Migration guide from version 2

* Delete `~/.vim/flavors` directory.
* Delete `runtime flavors/bootstrap.vim` line from your vimrc.
* In your dotfiles repository:
  * Rename `VimFlavor` as `Flavorfile`.
  * Rename `VimFlavor.lock` as `Flavorfile.lock`.
* If you use vim-flavor for Vim plugin development, do the following steps in
  that Vim plugin repository:
  * Update `Gemfile` to uses vim-flavor 3.0 or later,
    e.g., `gem 'vim-flavor', '~> 3.0'`.
  * Rename `VimFlavor` as `Flavorfile`.
  * Delete `.vim-flavor` directory.  It is used to stash runtime dependencies to
    run tests for your Vim plugin.
  * Note that you must not commit `Flavorfile.lock` for your Vim plugin.  It
    makes your plugin hard to use with other plugins.

  tests.

  are given as command-line arguments.
